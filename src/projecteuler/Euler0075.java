 * It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to
 * form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are
 * many more examples.
 *
 * 12 cm: (3,4,5)
 * 24 cm: (6,8,10)
 * 30 cm: (5,12,13)
 * 36 cm: (9,12,15)
 * 40 cm: (8,15,17)
 * 48 cm: (12,16,20)
 *
 * In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an
 * integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one
 * solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form
 * exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.
 *
 * 120 cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)
 *
 * Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L â‰¤ 1,500,000
 * can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?
